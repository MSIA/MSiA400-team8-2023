# MSiA400-team8-2023

## Description
<to be filled later when project is clearly defined>

## Weekly Updates
### Oct 14th
Updates:
- Set up GitHub repository shared with 4 team members, TA, and Prof Diego
- Set up pgAdmin and Northwestern VPN to query data in the future
- Import four tables (everything except skuinfo.csv) into pgAdmin for our team
- Directly import deptinfo.csv, skstinfo.csv, and strinfo.csv into pgAdmin
- Reorder columns of trnsact.csv and import into pgAdmin
- Create initial area of interest for ML problem: regression analysis on product discount information (could change in the future) 
  
Next Steps:
- "Play" with the data (EDA with SQL)
- Reconfirm the ML problem
- Clean skuinfo.csv data to upload into pgAdmin next week
- Generate framework to perform EDA on the data

### Oct 21st
Updates:
- Generate two business areas/questions to investigate (will decide on one final idea)
- First, what kind of products need more discounts than others to be sold? What kind of products can be sold with little amount of discounts?
-> Could regress discount amount onto features (will think of as many features that can effect this)
-> Problem/concern: 1,425,811 transactions from 120 millions transactions have OrgPrice = $0 (we could remove them -> [some hint from TA would be nice :)])
- Second, What products can be combined together to create "bulk sale" with some discount (compare to summing all products' prices)?
-> ML ideas: clustering analysis or doing association rule on transaction table -> see which products get bought together. 
-> Problem/concern: hard to quantify the result (ROI) -> we could split transaction table into train and test by a point in time.
- SKU table: notice extra commas in color values for some rows -> filter out these rows and will fix by changing that special comma into backslash and add them back to the data (in the process of cleaning)

Next steps:
- EDA mainly transaction table
- try to clean and upload SKU table
- adapt business/ML problem from TA's comments

### Oct 28th
Updates:
- Populated SKU table 
- Successfully connect pgAdmin to jupyter notebook
- Perform EDA on transaction tables (mainly) and other table (not yet on skutable)
- EDA -> this week focus on discount price business problem (SQL-based EDA)
- Transaction table
  - 120M records
  - 52.6% of transactions have discount -> 2004 48% (46M), 2005 55% (74.6M)
  - 300k rows are problematic (original price lower than amount paid) -> will be removed
  - joining with strinfo
  - 29 states -> discount proportion ranging from 41% to 60% (IA and IL are the top two while AR is at the bottom) -> state might not be the primary feature (could be helpful in tree for interaction term) -> the actual discount avg ranges from 48.6% to 57% 
  - 327 zip code, discount proportion ranging from 35% to 88% (disregard zip with 100% and 1 transaction) -> could be a good feature -> the actual discount avg ranges from 34% to 69%
  - Most of the columns in transaction tables are categorical variables, so doing correlation plots is not super meaningful.
- SKST table
  - Conducted EDA on skst table (found out missing values, obtained first and second moments for each variable, drawing distribution graphs for numeric features and correlation visualizations)
  
Next Steps:
- Perform EDA for SKU table (also joining it with transaction table)
- Perform additional EDA on transaction table in a probabilistic approach (pandas-based -> histogram and join correlation plot with other tables)
- Perform EDA for the second business question (in case the first business question doesn't work out)
  
### Nov 4th
Updates:
SKU
  - 1.556m rows for sku table (after excluded 9k problematic rows)
  - ~70k distinct colors
  - ~2.6k distinct brand
  
Brand with transaction
  - Max average discount at $555 (right skewed)
  - log transformed -> range from -2 to 2.74
  - proportion of discount transaction ranges from 0 to 100 (some brand appears on transaction table only a few times -> might need to determine some cutoff, such as 10 transaction, to determine that some brand have small transactions and create another feature indicating low-transaction brands)
  
Others
  - cost in sksinfo ranges from 0 to 2700, retail ranges from 0 to 6017
  - There were 11629 stores had total orgprice of 0 (out of 714499 stores)
  - over 92.5% of the transaction had R type and 7.5 % had P type
  - majority of the store does not have city/state info. For transaction made, 120914216 transactions donâ€™t have location info. Beyond that, Missoula, MT, Toledo, OH, and Little Rock, AR are the top three city where transactions happened
  
Next Steps:
  - Feature Engineering
  - Try Regression models: Ridge/Lasso regresison or Random Forest
